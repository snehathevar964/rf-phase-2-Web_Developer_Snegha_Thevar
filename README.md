## Summary
This project is part of Phase 2 of my internship. It has two parts: theory and practice. In the theory section, I will explore topics such as the difference between a website and a web app, the meaning of scalability, and the basics of Core Web Vitals, which are important measures of website performance. In the practical section, I will build a responsive multi‑page business website that includes form validation and API integration to make it more interactive and functional. Once the website is ready, I will deploy it on Netlify or Vercel. After deployment, I will test its performance using Google Lighthouse. Finally, I will collect screenshots and performance reports and add them to my GitHub repository for submission.
